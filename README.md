# CodecademyProProjects

In mid June, 2016, I signed up for Codecademy Pro, as the free version did not have as many options as I would have liked.  These are a few of the things I have worked on since beginning my training there.

These are quite disjointed, but I began to code them before I understood GitHub.  I just wanted a place to upload what I have accomplished over time.
